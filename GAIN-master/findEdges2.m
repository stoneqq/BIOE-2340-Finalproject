% Neighbor Encoding
%
% Each skeleton location can be assigned a positive value indicating the
% locations of all neighboring pixels within a 3x3 grid.  We start by assigning
% positive powers of 2 to each of the eight neighbors surrounding a location:
%
%   1 16  2
% 128  _ 32
%   8 64  4
%
% Since pixels that share a side have a higher path precedence than those
% that share a corner, the side pixels are encoded by higher values than
% the corner pixels.
%
% The neighbors can be combined into a single number by summing them.  For
% example 16 + 2 + 64 = 82.  Since unique powers of 2 are summed,
% individual neighbors can be recovered.  Thus, when a location in a binary
% array has the following neighbors:
%
% 0 1 1
% 0 _ 0
% 0 1 0
%
% We can encode this situation with the single, positive value 82.  We can
% then replace each of the 1s in a binary array with other numbers that
% represent the neighbors of the skeleton locations.
%
% Note that the presence of a side neighbor always forces the sum to be
% greater than 15 which can be quickly tested.
%
% When tracing a path, if the encoding of the preceding neighbor is known,
% it can be subtracted from the sum leaving at most a single encoded
% neighbor (for non-branch points) indicating the next pixel in the path.
% Note that the identification of the next path location requires no
% additional information from the array. So we eliminate the checking of
% the array for potential neighbors.
%
% Thus we trade the checking for potential neighbors for the cost of
% replacing 1s in an array with neighbor encodings.  Fortunately, the
% Matlab imfilter function can do this realtively efficiently.
